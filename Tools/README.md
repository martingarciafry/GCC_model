# GCC_Tools
The GCC model's toolset is a set of autonomous systems which enable users to create incrementally-reliable regional training datasets for land cover classification.   
Input datasets, metric sets, and documentation files can be downloaded from our Mendeley Data repository: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/mzp3k6fmtz

# Filtering Tool
The GCC model's filtering tool vets the spectral space of pre-existing land cover samples in a fused-canopy height vetting system to extract high-quality units for model training.

# Bias, variance decomposition tool
This tool enables the estimation of the loss in error derived from filtering samples of dubious quality from the training set. It requires reference samples (y-labels) and predictions made with a trained classifier (x-labels).

# Additional Information
We recommend use of raw multitemporal metrics given the frequency of amplitude signals carefully derived from Sentinel-2 satellite images. Optionally, new metric samples can be easily retrieved following our User's Guide I and candidate training samples can be gathered following our User's Guide II.

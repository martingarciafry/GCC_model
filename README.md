# GCC_model
The GCC model is a land use land cover classification model trained on automatically supervised labels to monitor post-disaster recovery through ground cover change. 
The model was created on a jupyter notebook in Google Colab (.ipynb). For convenience, you can access these files from our shared google drive where all the input data is also found: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1QNAOlBLWR-7ohyhBdzbA-DCeK4doqgSG

Practical applications of this model bridge multiple areas of study in monitoring and evaluating spatially-explicit phenomena. The datasets supply land management assistance to monitoring operations of the pre- and post-disturbance stages. This is useful for practitioners, stakeholders, and scholars interested in modeling, assessing, and evaluating land change initiatives in particular disaster-affected areas. 

# Brief Description
The Ground Cover Change (GCC) model represents a regional land change initiative targeting disaster-recurrent areas of the world where the interactions between land use and land cover change are necessary to quantify the environmental effects of post-disaster resettlement and secure the recovery of affected rural populations.

# Objectives
1) To understand the environmental implications of resettlement in stressed environments.

2) To produce regional classifiers and training sets in order to classify satellite images on demand.

3) To strengthen the resilience of rural communities through urban growth management schemes of development.

# Framework
The GCC framework is dictated by the availability of regionally consistent eco-zoned data metrics to secure high-quality regional training datasets. 
Mapping outcomes represent regional sectors subdivided by satellite image composite units of +/-5 degrees. 
The naming convention of maps takes root in the ISO 3166 country code, a three-letter code (alpha-3) to designate country names followed by map unit coordinates to reference world geodetic locations. 
The spatial resolution is ~30 m at the equator.
Classifications are categorized through predicted class values relative to seven basic land cover strata. These classes are derived from a pre-existing land cover product using a variation of FAO's Land & Water Land Cover Classification System (https://www.fao.org/land-water/land/land-governance/land-resources-planning-toolbox/category/details/en/c/1036361/).

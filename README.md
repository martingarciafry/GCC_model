# GCC_model
The GCC model is a novel land cover label supervision model that combines state-of-the-art machine learning techniques with three-dimensional quality control mechanisms to automatically detect high-quality training labels for semantic segmentation of remote sensing satellite images. This project not only addresses the challenge of acquiring high-quality labeled data, but also enables satellite image prediction with no temporal or modal constraint in regional extent. This allows for continuous monitoring of environmental and socioeconomic change, providing valuable insights to track program progress and make informed adjustments for sustainable growth. 

Practical applications bridge multiple areas of study in monitoring and evaluating spatially-explicit phenomena. Some of these studies include monitoring pre- and post-disturbance stages, adaptation and mitigation investments, causal land change effects, disaster recovery and resilience, and human-climate coupled Earth system sciences. This is useful for practitioners, stakeholders, and scholars interested in evaluating regional or site-specific spatiotemporal land change to inform climate action policy development. 

# Mission
The Ground Cover Change (GCC) model represents a regional land cover and land use change initiative targeting the rural periphery of urbanizing areas. These areas are becoming increasingly important to evaluate land change interactions and inform climate action policy experts and decision-makers. This model aims to pinpoint where urban growth management strategies are needed to protect carbon sinks and the environmental stability of rural areas, as well as for progress-tracking and informed decision-making.

# Objectives
1) To understand the environmental implications of disaster recovery for sustainable redevelopment and resilience planning.

2) To produce regional classifiers and training datasets for satellite image prediction on demand.

3) To reduce urban vulnerability through semi-urban, resilient, and sustainable urban development. 

# Contributions
1) Technical: Automated high-quality training data acquisition with no temporal or modal constraint in regional extent.
   
2) Technical: Spectro-vertical sample supervision increments data reliability.
   
3) Science: Fused values of forest structure circumvent label interpretation bias and increase the reliability of land change metrics.

# Framework
The GCC framework requires the availability of open-sourced, regionally-consistent multisource remote sensing data to secure high-quality training samples. 
Mapping outcomes represent regional sectors subdivided by satellite image composites of +/-5 degrees. 
The naming convention of maps takes root in the ISO 3166 country code, a three-letter code (alpha-3) to designate country names followed by map unit coordinates to reference world geodetic locations. 
The spatial resolution is ~30 m at the equator.
Classifications are categorized through predicted class values relative to seven basic land cover strata. These classes are derived from a pre-existing land cover product using a variation of FAO's Land & Water Land Cover Classification System (https://www.fao.org/land-water/land/land-governance/land-resources-planning-toolbox/category/details/en/c/1036361/).
